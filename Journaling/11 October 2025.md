## Why Did I change my Note taking Strategy
- recongibe that scarcity informed my earlier over note taking
- past trauma of failure forcong me to over stretch or prove that am capable
- knowong that i can always rereade the amnin article when needed in their site forces me to just read
- summarising in my own words focess me to think critically
- accepting that am not meant to remember everything
- moving foreard and reading many anf connecting is more important that being stuvck in one
- the articles of setting boundaries over your health and goodnerss also help, no nice guys
- recogniisng that failure is not due to memeory loss but due to lack of deciosn to suceed
- it is planning that brings success  not memory
- planning involves knowong what is needed and going about it strategically
- dont use presnt task to solve futute traumas
