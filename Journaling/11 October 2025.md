## Why Did I change my Note taking Strategy ?
- recongibe that scarcity informed my earlier over note taking
- past trauma of failure forcong me to over stretch or prove that am capable
- knowong that i can always rereade the amnin article when needed in their site forces me to just read
- summarising in my own words focess me to think critically
- accepting that am not meant to remember everything
- moving foreard and reading many anf connecting is more important that being stuvck in one
- the articles of setting boundaries over your health and goodnerss also help, no nice guys
- recogniisng that failure is not due to memeory loss but due to lack of deciosn to suceed
- it is planning that brings success  not memory
- planning involves knowong what is needed and going about it strategically
- dont use presnt task to solve futute traumas
- past ways of wasting time, experience may have contributed also
- decision to find a better way


## What made me follw a note template which earlier on I ignored 
- yoiu cant follow an instruction which your spirt has not accepted
- which you have not evolve to
- seeing and experience (internalise) reasons  not logical why you should
- if your world view is not in sync


## Application
- read and learn in momemts of dark night of the soul seek the wisdom and strategy giving to you in the light
